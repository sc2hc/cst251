<h2>Hello World(Aaron Borum)</h2>
	<p>
My name is Aaron Borum, and I currently run a ceramic business called ABCERAMICSS.
I started working with clay in 2016 and haven't stopped since.
I plan on expanding my business by acquiring land where I can build a studio (Currently working out of garage)
Aside from this, I enjoy meditation, investing, and taking care of my health by any means. I'm 24 years old and live in Salinas California.
Feel free to follow my instagram @ABCERAMICSS</P>
